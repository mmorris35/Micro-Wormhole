# Simple New Session Creation Test

Based on our manual tests, we know this works:

## What Works

1. Create new Claude PTY session (NO --resume flag)
2. Auto-accept bypass permissions
3. Claude warmup completes automatically (writes to JSONL)
4. We can find the session ID from the JSONL file

## Proof

From our tests today, we successfully created these new sessions:
- `28cdce10-cfe2-4246-9265-00a933719cdc` - Responded to warmup with full repo context!
- `79d19d68-f2fd-4b2a-a8d8-0fd49bac040c`
- `60c692dc-0d5e-4447-a8fc-aa2e7130de65`
- `5f4e91a0-fb72-4950-9e95-4ce7fa95a54f`

All created in AnarchistCookBook repo with full codebase context.

## The Working Approach

**For browser interaction with Claude Code:**
1. User selects a repo from the UI
2. Backend spawns NEW Claude session in that repo
3. Wait ~8 seconds for initialization
4. Find session ID from newest JSONL file in repo's session directory
5. User can now send messages via bracketed paste
6. Messages get written to JSONL by Claude
7. File watcher (Phase 9) detects changes and updates UI

## Next Steps

1. Simplify session creation to just wait 8 seconds + scan for JSONL
2. Add "New Claude Session" button to UI for each repo
3. Test end-to-end with message sending
4. ðŸŽ‰ Ship it!

This is MUCH simpler than trying to inject into existing sessions, and it actually WORKS!
